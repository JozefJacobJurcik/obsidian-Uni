>[!info] Ein *Axiom* ist eine Sequenz $Γ ⇒ ∆$ mit $Γ ∩ ∆ \ne ∅$.

Also $x ⇒ x,y$ ist ein Axiom

[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequent_calculus):
The items to the left of the turnstile are understood to be connected by conjunction, and those to the right by disjunction. Therefore, when both consist only of atomic symbols, the sequent is accepted axiomatically (and always true) if and only if at least one of the symbols on the right also appears on the left.
