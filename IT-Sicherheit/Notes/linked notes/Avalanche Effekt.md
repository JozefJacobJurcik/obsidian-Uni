aliases: avalanche effect
---

In cryptography, the avalanche effect is the desirable property of cryptographic algorithms, typically block ciphers and cryptographic hash functions, *wherein if an input is changed slightly (for example, flipping a single bit), the output changes significantly* (e.g., half the output bits flip). In the case of high-quality block ciphers, such *a small change* in either the key or the plaintext should *cause a drastic change in the ciphertext*. The actual term was first used by Horst Feistel, although the concept dates back to at least Shannon's diffusion.
