A **backdoor** is a typically *covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption* in a computer, product, embedded device (e.g. a home router), or its embodiment (e.g. part of a cryptosystem, algorithm, chipset, or even a "homunculus computer"â€”a tiny computer-within-a-computer such as that found in Intel's AMT technology). **Backdoors** are most often used for *securing remote access to a computer*, or *obtaining access to plaintext in cryptosystems*. From there it may be used to *gain access to privileged information* like passwords, *corrupt or delete data* on hard drives, or *transfer information* within autoschediastic networks.

A **backdoor** may take the form of a *hidden part of a program*, a *separate program* (e.g. Back Orifice may subvert the system through a rootkit), *code in the firmware of the hardware*, or *parts of an operating system* such as Windows. [[Trojan horse]]s can be used to create vulnerabilities in a device. Although some are secretly installed, *other backdoors are deliberate and widely known*. These kinds of backdoors have "legitimate" uses such as *providing the manufacturer with a way to restore user passwords*.
