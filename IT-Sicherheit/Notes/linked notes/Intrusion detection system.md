**An intrusion detection system** (IDS; also intrusion prevention system or IPS) is a device or software *application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations*. Any intrusion activity or violation is typically either reported to an administrator or collected centrally using a *security information and event management* (SIEM) system. A SIEM system combines outputs from multiple sources and uses alarm filtering techniques to distinguish malicious activity from false alarms.

IDS types range in scope from *single computers to large networks*. The most common classifications are **network intrusion detection systems** (**NIDS**) and **host-based intrusion detection systems** (**HIDS**). A system that monitors important operating system files is an example of an HIDS, while a system that analyzes incoming network traffic is an example of an NIDS. It is also possible to classify IDS by *detection approach*. The most well-known variants are **signature-based detection** (recognizing bad patterns, such as malware) and **anomaly-based detection** (detecting deviations from a model of "good" traffic, which often relies on machine learning). Another common variant is **reputation-based detection** (recognizing the potential threat according to the reputation scores). Some IDS products *have the ability to respond* to detected intrusions. Systems with response capabilities are typically referred to as an *intrusion prevention system*. Intrusion detection systems can also serve specific purposes by augmenting them with custom tools, such as using a *[[honeypot]] to attract and characterize malicious traffic*.
