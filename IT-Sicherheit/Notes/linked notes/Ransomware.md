**Ransomware** is a type of *cryptovirological malware* that permanently *block access to the victim's personal data unless a ransom is paid*. While some simple ransomware may lock the system without damaging any files, more advanced malware uses a technique called *cryptoviral extortion*. It encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible, and demands a ransom payment to decrypt them. In a properly implemented cryptoviral extortion attack, recovering the files without the decryption key is an intractable problem, and difficult to trace digital currencies such as paysafecard or Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are used for the ransoms, making tracing and prosecuting the perpetrators difficult.

Ransomware attacks are typically carried out using a [[Trojan horse|Trojan]] disguised as a legitimate file that the user is tricked into downloading or opening when it arrives as an email attachment. However, one high-profile example, the *WannaCry worm*, traveled automatically between computers without user interaction.
