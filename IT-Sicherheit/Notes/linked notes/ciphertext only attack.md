In [[Cryptography]], a *ciphertext-only attack (COA)* or known ciphertext attack is an attack model for [[Kryptoanalyse|cryptanalysis]] where the attacker is assumed to have access only to a set of [[Ciphertext]]s. While the attacker has no channel providing access to the [[Plaintext]] prior to encryption, in all practical ciphertext-only attacks, the attacker still has some knowledge of the plaintext. For instance, the attacker might know the language in which the plaintext is written or the expected statistical distribution of characters in the plaintext. Standard protocol data and messages are commonly part of the plaintext in many deployed systems, and can usually be guessed or known efficiently as part of a ciphertext-only attack on these systems.
