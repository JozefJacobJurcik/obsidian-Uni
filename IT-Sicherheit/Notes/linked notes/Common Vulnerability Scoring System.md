**The Common Vulnerability Scoring System** (**CVSS**) is a free and open industry *standard* for *assessing the severity of computer system security vulnerabilities*. CVSS attempts to assign severity scores to vulnerabilities, allowing responders to prioritize responses and resources according to threat. Scores are calculated based on a formula that depends on several metrics, that approximate ease and impact of an exploit. *Scores range from 0 to 10, with 10 being the most severe*. While many utilize only the CVSS Base score for determining severity, temporal and environmental scores also exist, to factor in availability of mitigations and how widespread vulnerable systems are within an organization, respectively.

The current version of CVSS (CVSSv4.0) was released in November 2023.

Terminology

### The CVSS assessment measures three areas of concern:

1. **Base Metrics** for qualities intrinsic to a vulnerability
2. **Temporal Metrics** for characteristics that evolve over the lifetime of vulnerability
3. **Environmental Metrics** for vulnerabilities that depend on a particular implementation or environment

A numerical score is generated for each of these metric groups. A vector string (or simply "vector" in CVSSv2), represents the values of all the metrics as a block of text.
