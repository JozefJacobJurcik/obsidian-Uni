In computing, a **Trojan horse** is any malware that m*isleads users of its true intent by disguising itself as a standard program*. The term is derived from the ancient Greek story of the deceptive Trojan Horse that led to the fall of the city of Troy.

Trojans are generally *spread by some form of social engineering*. For example, where a user is duped into executing an email attachment disguised to appear innocuous (e.g., a routine form to be filled in), or by clicking on a fake advertisement on social media or anywhere else. Although their payload can be anything, *many modern forms act as a backdoor*, contacting a controller who can then have unauthorized access to the affected computer. [[Ransomware]] attacks are often carried out using a Trojan.

Unlike computer [[virus]]es and [[worm]]s, Trojans generally *do not attempt to inject themselves into other files or otherwise propagate themselves.*
