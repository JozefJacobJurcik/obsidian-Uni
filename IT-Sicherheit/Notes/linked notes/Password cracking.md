In cryptanalysis and computer security, **password cracking** is the process of recovering passwords from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system in scrambled form. A common approach ([[Brute Force]] attack) is to repeatedly try guesses for the password and to check them against an available cryptographic hash of the password. Another type of approach is [[Password spraying]], which is often automated and occurs slowly over time in order to remain undetected, using a list of common passwords.
