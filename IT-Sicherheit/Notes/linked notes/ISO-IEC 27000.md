## PDCA 
PDCA or **plan–do–check–act** (sometimes called plan–do–check–adjust) is an iterative design and management method used in business for the control and continual improvement of processes and products.

### Plan
Establish objectives and processes required to deliver the desired results.
### Do
Carry out the objectives from the previous step.
### Check

During the check phase, the data and results gathered from the do phase are evaluated. Data is compared to the expected outcomes to see any similarities and differences. The testing process is also evaluated to see if there were any changes from the original test created during the planning phase. If the data is placed in a chart it can make it easier to see any trends if the plan–do–check–act cycle is conducted multiple times. This helps to see what changes work better than others and if said changes can be improved as well.

Example: [Gap analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_analysis "Gap analysis") or [appraisals](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/appraisal "wikt:appraisal")
### Act
Also called "adjust", this act phase is where a process is improved. Records from the "do" and "check" phases help identify issues with the process. These issues may include problems, non-conformities, opportunities for improvement, inefficiencies, and other issues that result in outcomes that are evidently less-than-optimal. Root causes of such issues are investigated, found, and eliminated by modifying the process. Risk is re-evaluated. At the end of the actions in this phase, the process has better instructions, standards, or goals. Planning for the next cycle can proceed with a better baseline. Work in the next do phase should not create a recurrence of the identified issues; if it does, then the action was not effective.
