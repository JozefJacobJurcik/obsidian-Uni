**Phishing** is a form of [[Social engineering]] and *scam* where attackers *deceive people into revealing sensitive information* or *installing malware* such as [[ransomware]]. **Phishing** attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and often transparently mirror the site being targeted, allowing the attacker to observe everything while the victim is navigating the site, and transverse any additional security boundaries with the victim. As of 2020, *it is the most common type of cybercrime*, with the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center reporting more incidents of phishing than any other type of computer crime.
