## Theoretical Preparation

### 1. Basic Concepts to Understand

- **Converging lens (Sammellinse)**: Focuses parallel light rays to a point
- **Diverging lens (Streulinse)**: Spreads parallel light rays outward
- **Focal point (Brennpunkt)**: Where parallel rays converge after passing through a lens
- **Principal planes (Hauptebenen)**: Reference planes for measuring object and image distances
- **Virtual image (virtuelles Bild)**: Image that appears to come from a position where no light actually originates

### 2. Ray Construction Methods

For constructing ray paths through lenses, remember the three principal rays:

- **Axis-parallel ray**: A ray parallel to the optical axis that passes through the focal point after refraction
- **Focal point ray**: A ray through the focal point that emerges parallel to the optical axis
- **Central ray**: A ray through the center of the lens that continues straight without deviation

### 3. Lens Equation

The fundamental imaging equation: 1/g + 1/b = 1/f

Where:

- g = object distance
- b = image distance
- f = focal length

### 4. Matrix Optics

For the specific task in section 2.1.3, you need to derive an expression for focal length using matrix optics:

The ray transfer matrix for a thin lens is: [1 0] [-1/f 1]

Using this approach, you can establish the relationship between object and image heights (G and B) and derive the focal length expression.

## Preparation Tasks

### 1. Matrix Method Derivation (Section 2.1.3)

Using the matrix method, we can derive the focal length from image and object sizes:

The matrix equation for a thin lens system is: [y_2] = [1 0] [y_1] [θ_2] [-1/f 1] [θ_1]

For an object at distance g and image at distance b: B/G = b/g

From the matrix operations, we can derive: f = (g·b)/(g+b)

This gives us a way to determine the focal length from measured values of g, b, G, and B.

### 2. Graphic Construction Preparation (Section 2.2.2)

For the lens system construction task, I'll outline the approach for finding the focal points and principal planes:

1. Start with the known positions: object, converging lens, diverging lens, and final image
2. First identify the image created by just the converging lens
3. Use this as a virtual object for the diverging lens
4. For constructing focal points:
    - F_s (converging lens focal point): Use parallel rays from the object
    - F_s' (converging lens image-side focal point): Where parallel rays to the axis converge
    - F_z and F_z' (diverging lens focal points): Similar approach with the diverging lens
    - F and F' (system focal points): Points where parallel incident rays converge after passing through both lenses

### 3. Answers to Questions in Technical Basics (Section 2.1.2)

**Question 1: What advantage does a mercury vapor lamp have over a normal incandescent lamp?** The mercury vapor lamp emits distinct, separated spectral lines rather than a continuous spectrum. This allows for monochromatic light by filtering specific wavelengths, reducing chromatic aberration in the optical system and providing more precise measurements.

**Question 2: Why must the screen not be mounted the other way around?** The rough (matte) side of the screen must face the lens because it diffusely scatters the incoming light, making the image visible from the other side. If mounted backwards, the image would form inside the clear material, creating reflections and making precise measurements difficult.

I hope this preparation helps with your lab experiment! Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the experiment or theoretical background?
